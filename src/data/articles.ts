          "When discussing agency spending, the conversation often focuses solely on the hourly rates paid to temporary staff. This narrow view misses the deeper financial impact. A band 5 nurse working through an agency typically costs 50-100% more than their permanently employed counterpart.",
          "Perhaps equally concerning is how agency dependence undermines effective financial planning. Trusts might carefully set budget allocations at the start of the financial year, only to find themselves forced into unplanned agency spending due to unexpected staff shortages or seasonal pressures.",

          "Staff morale and retention suffer when permanent employees see agency colleagues earning significantly more for similar work. Each permanent staff member who leaves for agency work represents both a loss of institutional knowledge and an almost certain increase in future staffing costs.",
